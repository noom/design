        <description>
            This section of the design guides aims to establish a development framework that helps create responsive layouts quickly and efficiently. The color and aesthetic suggestions are in line with the published brand guide. If you notice anything is wrong or needs to be changed, you can report an issue by bothering the DUX team (<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>).
