        This section of the These guidelines are intended to help standardize mockups and design for Noom's core application: Noom Coach. This does not include each individual element or interaction in the app, but rather aims to provide the design patterns which make up the core Noom Coach Features.

        <description>
        This guideline will be an on-going project, and will be continuously revised and expanded to suit changing product needs.
